            "If we can imagine something, there is a good chance that it will
            happen. If we don’t imagine it, there is almost no chance of it
            happening. (From A World of Three Zeros: The New Economics of Zero
            Poverty, Zero Unemployment, and Zero Net Carbon Emissions.) To me,
            the poor are like Bonsai trees. When you plant the best seed of the
            tallest tree in a six-inch deep flower pot, you get a perfect
            replica of the tallest tree, but it is only inches tall. There is
            nothing wrong with the seed you planted; only the soil-base you
            provided was inadequate. Poor people are bonsai people. There is
            nothing wrong with their seeds. Only society never gave them a base
            to grow on"
